% \chapter*{Preface}

% This notes are the result of a seminar that took place on the first semester of 12018 at the National University of Colombia at Medell√≠n. The objective of the seminar was to cover the basics of Machine Learning needed to understand neural networks. To do so, we followed a rather theoretical approach to the subject. Our main references were \cite{bishop1} and \cite{bishop2} (and these books are so well made that most of our notes are almost verbatum copies from them). For a holistic understanding of the subject, though, we implemented most examples using python and R and following a [MOOC] on Udemy.
